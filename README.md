# How to deal with panel data

![alternative text](img/readme_image.jpg)

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Objective
When working with datasets, it is always important to properly understand the data we are tackling. Cross-sectional data, time series data, panel data, pooled time series data, there are just so many. I therefore decided to research some articles specifically related to panel data to get to know this type of data better. The final goal is to create and adapt a theoretical walkthrough based on the existing resources found on the internet.
