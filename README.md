# How to forecast energy consumption for the Ticino region

![alternative text](img/readme_image.jpg)

#### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Objective
Even tough I still haven't revised Deep Learning and Tensorflow yet, I decided to analyze the power grid energy consumption in Ticino (Switzerland) from 2018 to 2022. Instead of going back to the notebooks I used during my bootcamp, I decided to find a walkthrough and adapt it to the data I used for this project. The goal was to recreate and adapt a walkthrough based on existing sources online and replicate LSTM for the dataset selected.
